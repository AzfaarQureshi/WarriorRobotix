      VEX Robotics Competition Nothing But Net is played on a 12’x12’ square field configured as seen above. Two alliances – one “red” and one “blue” – composed of two teams each, compete in matches consisting of a fifteen second autonomous period followed by one minute and forty-five seconds of driver-controlled play.

      VEX Skyrise was the latest challenge thrust upon us. The premise was fairly simple, putting cubes on to posts that dotted the edges of the arena. However, there were also yellow pegs called skyrises that could be stacked upon to create a 5 foot tall tower! Additional cubes can then be placed on these skyrises for even more points. During the first competition we were on a slow start but managed to make it to the quarterfinals, we also won the Judges Award. We tweaked around our design and despite some issues we managed to make it to the semi-finals and play five tiebreaker rounds before losing. 2 weeks were spent rebuilding and it paid off when we won the next competition and two additional awards: Programming Skills and The Think. Having achieved our berth in the provincials we had another competition left. We ended up winning the tournament and taking home another two awards: Robot Skills and Excellence. When we made it to the provincials we ended up in the semi-finals and won the Innovate award. Also, due to our proficiency in robot and programming skills we were invited to the World Championships in Louisville, Kentucky. The next two months were devoted to practice, refinement,  and scouting. During the competition we did exceptionally well and made it to the Division Finals before losing to the team who would be the champions. While upset that we didn’t win we know that much more for the next competition: Nothing but Net!
