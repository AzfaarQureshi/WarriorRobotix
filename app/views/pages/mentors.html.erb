      Here at Warrior Robotix we pride ourselves by following our simple motto: Design. Build. Win. and for us it has worked effectively. We are based out of Port Credit Secondary School in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and have been competing in tournaments such as VEX and Skills Canada. We founded Warrior Robotix back in 2012 and have worked ourselves into one of the elite teams in high school robotics. We offer not only the materials for a successful member but also the skills and character building that not only will help in robotics but also in life. If you are interested in joining robotics come and join Warrior Robotix today!
